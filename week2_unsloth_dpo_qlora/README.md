**Fitness QA Fine-Tuning Project**

---

### **Main Motto of the Project**

The goal of this project is to create a **specialized fitness question-answering bot** that can understand nuanced questions and provide accurate, context-aware answers. This is achieved by fine-tuning a large language model specifically for fitness-related queries using advanced training techniques while keeping resource efficiency in mind.

### **Detailed Processing Workflow**

#### **1. Dataset Preparation**

The training process starts with preparing the dataset. Fitness QA datasets are loaded from JSON files containing pairs of questions and answers (chosen vs. rejected). Cleaning and preprocessing ensure high-quality inputs for training. This includes:

* Removing empty or malformed entries.
* Standardizing the text.
* Restricting dataset size for controlled experiments.

Configuration choices here define the dataset paths and limits to balance quality and training efficiency.

#### **2. Model Selection**

The project uses **Unsloht’s Qwen3-0.6B** model as the base because:

* **Optimized performance**: Unsloht provides models fine-tuned for efficiency.
* **Compatibility with quantization**: Supports 4-bit quantization for low memory usage.
* **Scalability**: Can be further fine-tuned with LoRA without retraining the whole model.

The configuration specifies parameters like sequence length and quantization flags to control memory and computation.

#### **3. Fine-Tuning Strategy**

**Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** is chosen because it enables optimizing the model based on preference data rather than traditional supervised fine-tuning.

* Focuses on improving model alignment with human feedback.
* Works well for preference-based tasks such as choosing better answers.

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is applied to the base model for fine-tuning because:

* It drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters.
* Requires less computational power and memory.
* Makes it feasible to fine-tune large models even in constrained environments like Kaggle.

#### **4. Training Process**

DPOTrainer orchestrates the fine-tuning process, using configuration parameters for batch size, learning rate, gradient accumulation, epochs, etc.

* Gradient checkpointing is enabled for memory efficiency.
* Logging steps are configured for intermediate progress tracking.

wandb integration is added to track metrics such as loss, gradient norms, learning rate changes, and sample generations during training, ensuring reproducibility and transparency.

#### **5. Inference**

Once fine-tuned, the model is loaded with the inference configuration. The inference function processes the user query by:

* Applying a chat template.
* Tokenizing and preparing input tensors.
* Generating the response while ensuring model and input tensors reside on the same device to avoid errors.

The inference configuration allows flexibility to change model path and sequence length without modifying the code.
