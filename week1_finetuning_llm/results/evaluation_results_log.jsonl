{"prompt": "Can I train arms and back on the same day?", "expected_completion": "Yes, it's effective. Back and biceps are pulling muscles and work well together. Include rows and curls.", "actual_completion": "Yes, you can train arms and back together. They are often paired in a \"pull\" workout since both involve pulling movements. This allows you to exhaust back muscles first, then move to biceps.", "similarity_score": 0.313}
{"prompt": "What’s the best routine for training chest and triceps?", "expected_completion": "Combine bench press, incline dumbbell press, cable flys for chest and dips, rope pushdowns, skull crushers for triceps.", "actual_completion": "Train chest and triceps together on the same day. A good routine includes bench press, incline dumbbell press, chest flies, and tricep dips.", "similarity_score": 0.471}
{"prompt": "Give me a warm-up before workout", "expected_completion": "Start with 5 minutes light cardio, dynamic stretches (leg swings, hip circles), and activation like glute bridges or squats.", "actual_completion": "Start with 5 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, brisk walking). Do dynamic stretches like leg swings, arm circles, and hip circles.", "similarity_score": 0.592}
{"prompt": "Which muscles are trained during squats?", "expected_completion": "Squats mainly target quads, glutes, hamstrings, and also engage the core and lower back stabilizers.", "actual_completion": "Squats work the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. They also engage the core for stability.", "similarity_score": 0.677}
{"prompt": "List exercises for shoulders", "expected_completion": "Overhead press, lateral raise, front raise, reverse flys, and upright row target deltoids.", "actual_completion": "Effective shoulder exercises include overhead press, lateral raises, front raises, and reverse flys.", "similarity_score": 0.589}
{"prompt": "What are compound exercises?", "expected_completion": "Compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench press, and pull-ups engage multiple muscle groups and joints.", "actual_completion": "Compound exercises work multiple muscles. Include squats, deadlifts, bench press, pull-ups, and overhead press.", "similarity_score": 0.643}
{"prompt": "Can I train arms and back on the same day?", "expected_completion": "Yes, it's effective. Back and biceps are pulling muscles and work well together. Include rows and curls.", "actual_completion": "Yes, you can train arms and back together. They target different muscle groups, so you can effectively train them on the same day.", "similarity_score": 0.333}
{"prompt": "Which muscles does deadlift target?", "expected_completion": "Deadlifts target glutes, hamstrings, lower back, traps, and core muscles.", "actual_completion": "Deadlifts target back, glutes, hamstrings, and core muscles like abs and obliques.", "similarity_score": 0.697}
{"prompt": "How often should I train legs?", "expected_completion": "Train legs 1–2 times per week with at least 48 hours of recovery between sessions.", "actual_completion": "Train legs 1-2 times per week, allowing 48 hours of rest between sessions.", "similarity_score": 0.821}
{"prompt": "What’s a good ab workout routine?", "expected_completion": "Do planks, leg raises, bicycle crunches, and toe touches for a full ab routine. 3 sets of 15 reps each.", "actual_completion": "A great ab workout includes planks, hanging leg raises, Russian twists, and crunches.", "similarity_score": 0.351}
{"prompt": "How many sets and reps should I do?", "expected_completion": "For muscle growth, do 3–4 sets of 8–12 reps per exercise with challenging weights.", "actual_completion": "3-4 sets of 8-12 reps are ideal for muscle growth.", "similarity_score": 0.258}
